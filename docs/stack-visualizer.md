# Stack Visualizer

The Stack Visualizer lets you track spells and abilities in a LIFO stack. It is designed for table play and learning how the stack resolves.

## How It Works

- New items are added to the top of the stack.
- Resolve Top removes the top item and adds it to the resolution history.
- Priority shows who can respond next; pass it to move around the table.
- State is saved locally and restored on refresh.

## Quick Add

Use the quick buttons for common actions:
- Counter
- Destroy
- Damage
- Draw
- Trigger
- Activate

Each quick add prompts for controller and optional target text.

## Full Add

Use the full add modal to search Scryfall and attach oracle text and card art to the stack entry.

## Resolution History

Resolved items appear in a history panel so the table can review what already resolved this turn.

## Tips

- Use "New Stack" to reset players and history between games.
- Use the help panel for a quick reminder; it can be dismissed.
